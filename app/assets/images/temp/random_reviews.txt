This excellent and nutritious soup is a godsend for using the stale
bread that must never again be thrown away. It is composed of bread
crumbs and grated bread, eggs, grated cheese, nutmeg (in very small
quantity) and salt, all mixed together and put in broth previously
prepared, which must be warm at the moment of the immersion, but not at
the boiling point. Then place it on a low fire and stir gently. Any
vegetable left over may be added.
The best and most tender paste is made simply of eggs, flour and salt,
water may be substituted for part of the eggs, for economy, or when a
less rich paste is needed. Allow about a cup of flour to an egg. Put the
flour on a bread board, make a hollow in the middle and break in the
egg. Use any extra whites that are on hand. Knead it thoroughly, adding
more flour if necessary, until you have a paste you can roll out. Roll
it as thin as an eighth of an inch. A long rolling pin is necessary, but
any stick, well scrubbed and sand papered, will serve in lieu of the
long Italian rolling pin.
Cut from this sheet of paste rounds measuring about three inches in
diameter. In the middle of each circle place a spoonful of filling that
must be made beforehand, composed of cooked meat (chicken, pork or veal)
ground very fine and seasoned with grated cheese, grated lemon peel,
nutmeg, allspice, salt. The ground meat is to be mixed with an equal
amount of curds or cottage cheese.
When the filling is placed in the circle of paste, fold the latter over
and moisten the edge of the paste with the finger dipped in water to
make it stay securely closed.
These =cappelletti= should be cooked in chicken or beef broth until the
paste is tender, and served with this broth as a soup.
Put on the fire a pot with two quarts of salted water to which add a
small piece of butter. When it begins to boil put in it 3/4 lb.
macaroni. Let it boil for five minutes, then drain them in a colander.
Put them again in new boiling water, prepared as above and let them cook
on a slow fire. Drain them again. Cover the bottom of a plate with
macaroni and cover this first layer with grated cheese and with some
vegetables in macédoine, that is, chopped fine and fried brown with
butter. Repeat the draining, moisten the macaroni with the water in
which they have previously cooked and keep on a low fire for ten minutes
more.

the best pizza! go early to avoid the waiting time. this place gets busy and it's no wonder!
Ignore the tourists and delve into the best New York-sytle pizza on Earth. The freshest, most flavorful ingredients on top of a heavenly coal-fired crust. You will not be tossing aside the crust of this pizza!
beware long lines and molto touristas, but this legend - the first pizzeria in america since 1905 has survived downtimes and an expansion and still turns out primo pies
I was deeply disappointed with the pizza this trip. So much that I will never go back. I went a few years ago and loved it, last night was a whole different experience. One side was burnt, which I don't mind, while the other side was almost raw
loved the wild mushroom pizza topping. kitchy atmosphere. the place was packed at 6pm on a sunday. delicious creamy italian house dressing.
The appeal of Lombardi's is twofold: Very good, crispy, thin crust pizzas made in a fantastic coal-fired oven; and an EXTREMELY attentive staff that will treat you as if you're royalty.
After eating here, I can't eat pizza the same way. I would definitely say the minerals in the water make an amazing pizza. By far, one of the best pizza places I've visited.
"People may hark on the fact that this is NYC's first and ""best"" pizzeria. However, the pizza isn't that great. Don't get me wrong, it's pretty good pizza. It just doesn't stack up that well against some of the other New York pizzas on the list."
still the first and the best! best tasting pizza on this planet. the secret is in the dough and in the brick oven. most toppings are outstanding. tomatoes that accompany mozzarella starter are so fresh you'd think they grew in an on-site garden
One of the best pizzas I have ever had!!! Loved the fresh marinara sauce and the mozzarella cheese they use. Love their menu, simple and straight to the point for pizza lovers. ONLY CASH!!! and super crowded!
The =Macédoine= of vegetables can be made with a dozen Bruxelles sprouts
or one cabbage, half a dozen big asparagus cut in little pieces, a
carrot cut in thin slices, a dozen small onions, some turnips and half a
dozen mushrooms. The mushrooms and the asparagus can be omitted. Melt
some butter in a saucepan and when the turnips, the carrots and the
onions are half cooked, add the cabbage or sprouts. Put in some water
and some more butter, boil for ten minutes and then add the mushrooms
and the asparagus, adding salt and pepper, and a little sugar if this is
desired.
Cook in water one cup of yellow cornmeal making a stiff mush. Salt it
well and when it is cooked spread out to cool on a bread board about
half an inch thick. Then cut the mush into small squares.
Put in a saucepan several whole sausages with a little water, and when
they are cooked skin and crush them and add some brown stock or tomato
sauce.
Put the polenta (or cornmeal mush) in a fireproof receptacle, season
with grated cheese, the crushed sausages and a piece of butter. Put it
in the oven and serve when hot.
For this dish it is preferable to have good sized eels that must not be
skinned, but cut in small pieces.
Chop some onion and parsley, put it on the fire with oil, salt, and
pepper, and when the onion is browned, add the pieces of eel. Wait until
it has absorbed the taste of the onion sauce and then complete the
cooking with tomato sauce (No. 12).
See that there is plenty of gravy and serve with little squares or
diamonds of toast.
This is a convenient way to prepare left-over celery that is still too
good to be thrown away.
Clean the left-over celery removing as best you can the sauce in which
they were served, dip in frying paste (flour and egg) fry and serve with
lemon.
Prepare some hard boiled eggs, cut them through the middle lengthwise,
place in good order upon a plate and pour some good tomato sauce, taking
care not to cover the upper part of the eggs, which must emerge from the
sauce.
Instead of the tomato, the eggs may be arranged with a =balsamella=
sauce (No. 54).
Skin the pistaches in warm water and grind them very fine with a
tablespoonful of the sugar, then put in a saucepan with the yolks and
the sugar, mixing everything together. Add the milk and put the mixture
on the fire stirring with the ladle and when it is condensed like cream,
let it cool and put in the freezer.
Take several varieties of fruits of the season, ripe and of good
quality, that is to say, strawberries, cherries, plums, apricots, a big
peach, a good sized pear, a piece of good cantaloupe. Peel, skin and
remove stones and cores of all these fruits. Then cut them into very
thin slices, throwing away the cores and stones.
When the fruit is prepared in this manner, weigh it, and sprinkle over
one fifth of its weight of powdered sugar, squeezing also one lemon.
Mix everything and let the mixture rest for half an hour.
Put a sheet of paper in the bottom of the mold that is to be filled with
the fruit pressed together, close, and pack in salt and ice, keeping it
for two hours or a little less.
This is not the =tutti frutti= ice cream as is known in America, but a
=macédoine= of fruits, that comes very pleasant to the taste in the
summer months.
Roll a lump of butter in flour, put it in a pan on the fire, and as
it melts add pepper and salt. Stir it, and as it thickens add a little
milk; let it simmer and keep on stirring it. You will never get a good
white sauce unless you season it well and let it simmer for a quarter
of an hour. Strain it, heat it again, and serve it for fish, potatoes,
chicken.
Put the back and the hind legs of one or two rabbits in an oven,
covering the same first with a layer of butter (half inch thick) and
then with a layer of French mustard, pepper and salt. Roast by a good
fire for one hour, baste often with the juice from the meat and the
gravy.
Mothers of girls should think it more important to furnish
healthful exercise, wholesome food and restful sleep during
the years of budding womanhood, than to worry about lessons
in music and art, or a business education. All these can be
taken up with much greater benefit after maturity. Arrested
development of the organs of reproduction will lay the
foundation for many years of unhappiness and suffering.
Many parents are impressed with the idea that their children
require a large amount of sweets, in order to make them grow.
We cannot force nature without paying the penalty. At
maturity, we reap what has been sown for us, or what we have
sown for ourselves.
If a housewife does not have sufficient time to go
through the various processes involved in making soup, her family need
not be deprived of this article of diet, for there are a number of
concentrated meat and vegetable extracts on the market for making soups
quickly. The _meat extracts_ are made of the same flavoring material as
that which is drawn from meat in the making of stock. Almost all the
liquid is evaporated and the result is a thick, dark substance that must
be diluted greatly with water to obtain the basis for a soup or a broth.
Some of the _vegetable extracts,_ such as Japanese soy and English
marmite, are so similar in appearance and taste to the meat extracts as
to make it quite difficult to detect any difference. Both varieties of
these extracts may be used for sauces and gravies, as well as for soups,
but it should be remembered that they are not highly nutritious and are
valuable merely for flavoring.
To obtain the most flavor from meat that is properly prepared, it
should be put over a slow fire and allowed to come gradually to the
boiling point. As the water approaches the boiling point, a scum
consisting of coagulated albumin, blood, and foreign material will begin
to rise to the top, but this should be skimmed off at once and the
process of skimming continued until no scum remains. When the water
begins to boil rapidly, either the fire should be lowered or the kettle
should be removed to a cooler part of the stove so that the water will
bubble only enough for a very slight motion to be observed. Throughout
the cooking, the meat should not be allowed to boil violently nor to
cease bubbling entirely.
The meat should be allowed to cook for at least 4 hours, but longer if
possible. If, during this long cooking, too much water evaporates, more
should be added to dilute the stock. The salt that is required for
seasoning may be added just a few minutes before the stock is removed
from the kettle. However, it is better to add the salt, together with
the other seasonings, after the stock has been drawn off, for salt, like
heat, has a tendency to harden the tissues of meat and to prevent the
flavor from being readily extracted.
Of uncooked vegetables, cabbage lettuce--called long ago by the Greek
physician, Galen, the philosopher's or wise man's herb--stands at the
head of salad plants. Like all uncooked vegetables, lettuce must be
served fresh and crisp, and the more quickly it is grown the more tender
it will be. When dressed for the table, each leaf should glisten with
oil, yet no perceptible quantity should fall to the salad-bowl.
Watercress, being rich in sulphuretted oil, is often served without oil.
Cheese or eggs combine well with cress; and such a salad, with a
sandwich of coarse bread and butter, together with a cup of sparkling
coffee, forms an ideal luncheon for a picnic or for the home piazza.
Indeed, all the compound salads,--that is, salads of many
ingredients,--more particularly if they are served with a cooked or
mayonnaise dressing, are substantial enough for the chief dish of a
hearty meal. Their digestibility depends, in large measure, on the
tenderness of the different ingredients, as well as upon the freshness
of the uncooked vegetables that enter into their composition.
A salad has this superiority over every other production of the culinary
art: A salad (but not every salad) is suitable to serve upon any
occasion, or to any class or condition of men. Among _bon vivants_,
without a _new_ salad, no matter how _recherché_ the other courses may
be, the luncheon, or dinner party, of to-day does not pass as an
unqualified success.
While salads may be compounded of all kinds of delicate meats, fish,
shellfish, eggs, nuts, fruit, cheese and vegetables, cooked or uncooked,
two things are indispensable to every kind and grade of salad, viz., the
foundation of vegetables and the dressing.
Pound dried lobster coral in a mortar, sift, and add gradually to the
dressing, to secure the shade desired. Or, after the salad is arranged
in the bowl, or in nests, mask the top with mayonnaise of the usual
color, and sift the coral over the centre, leaving a ring of yellow
around the edge.
Mix a level teaspoonful of Italian tomato pulp with a teaspoonful of
mayonnaise dressing, and when well blended beat very thoroughly into a
cup or more of the dressing, or add dressing until the desired tint is
attained.
This place has been doing the best Pizza since years. I had most amazing pie with some friends a few days ago. Only thing I don't like siting downstairs, but the place was pack.

Best place to go in Little Italy for pizza! I remember going here as a kid and waiting for hours, but the pizza was brick oven and tasted great. I would say go on a Friday night but it gets very crowded and it is not worth the ridiculous wait.
As strange as the clam pie sounds it's indescribably delicious. Thin crust and no sauce sounds weird but the olive oil and cheese somehow make you forget. The italian soda is okay and service is good, not great. even though there's always a wait
A trip to NYC isn't complete without a visit to Lombardi's. Its got a great reputation for a reason. The white pizza is without a doubt the best pizza I've ever tasted! There Italian sodas are also great, and often overlooked. Do try them!
