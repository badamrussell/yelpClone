is there a good way to go back, like done with a form, after submit go back to previous page

implement price_range, add it to review
dollar signs reflect actual price_range




other user pages





some redundancy in tables user_id and review_id...
complex searching ( how to stack searches )
search price range
search by distance
search sorting

improve sql searching (lots for the user/vote buttons)
friends...

random user images for seed photos

ask confirmation before deleting
how to crop photos for mosaic
toggle list view from mosaic
data dependencies


Data validation (is correct type)
html_safe...

flagging

BIG seed data

clean up routes

new businesses




links should add to searches



SECURITY

Implement businesses recently opened

SQL INSERTION ATTACKS
category pages have names instead of ids
save reviews (to submit for later)
reviews do not save formatting...



TIME-CONSUMING BUGS
-------------------------------
ON BAD REVIEW VALIDATION, FEATURES ARE STILL ADDED AND FORM IS NOT PREFILLED...

MAYBE WAIT FOR JS...
------------------------------
Navigate photos
list all photos on photo show
drag drop photos in


RECOMMENDED FEATURES TO ADD
-------------------------------







----------------------------------------------

can edit coompliment
do categories better (better way than the three columns)
show counters on review votes
show categories in various review partials and business page
show search terms on top of search page
fix columns partial
Search page reviews are not with correct business
go from category page to search with correct search parameters
are categories correct?


Category page
change BusinessFeatures to have review_id instead of user_id
Faker Data
2 columns working
delete reviews
DOES NOT CONSIDER IF USER HAS ALREADY ADDED FEATURES BEFORE....
edit own reviews

Reviews can have pictures
reviews display reverse order
Business Photos Page
submit initial review with new business
clicking photos not going to right page
Rename Category and SubCategory
how does user storefront selection relate to actual storefront
   maybe it should choose the top three storefront images
Star Images reflect actual rating
Can change storefront photo
stores show storefront photo as avatar image
