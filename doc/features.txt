??????????????? incrementing messed up for review form

go from category page to search with correct search parameters
Search page reviews are not with correct business
css practice for test...
Upvoting
show counters on review votes
dollar signs reflect actual price_range

figaro
google maps

site location name? (i.e. best in... New York)
do categories better (better way than the three columns)

complex searching ( how to stack searches )





random user images for seed photos

ask confirmation before deleting
how to crop photos for mosaic
toggle list view from mosaic
data dependencies

feedback messages (flash[:errors] and success)
Data validation (is correct type)
html_safe...


BIG seed data

clean up routes

new businesses


other user pages

links should add to searches



SECURITY

Implement businesses recently opened

SQL INSERTION ATTACKS
category pages have names instead of ids
save reviews (to submit for later)
reviews do not save formatting...



TIME-CONSUMING BUGS
-------------------------------
ON BAD REVIEW VALIDATION, FEATURES ARE STILL ADDED AND FORM IS NOT PREFILLED...

MAYBE WAIT FOR JS...
------------------------------
Navigate photos
list all photos on photo show
drag drop photos in


RECOMMENDED FEATURES TO ADD
-------------------------------







----------------------------------------------
Category page
change BusinessFeatures to have review_id instead of user_id

are categories correct?

Faker Data
2 columns working
delete reviews
DOES NOT CONSIDER IF USER HAS ALREADY ADDED FEATURES BEFORE....
edit own reviews

Reviews can have pictures
reviews display reverse order
Business Photos Page
submit initial review with new business
clicking photos not going to right page
Rename Category and SubCategory
how does user storefront selection relate to actual storefront
   maybe it should choose the top three storefront images
Star Images reflect actual rating
Can change storefront photo
stores show storefront photo as avatar image
