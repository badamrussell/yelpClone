search price range
search by distance
search sorting

improve sql searching (lots for the user/vote buttons)

data dependencies


Data validation (is correct type)
html_safe...

flagging

BIG seed data

links should add to searches



SECURITY

Implement businesses recently opened

SQL INSERTION ATTACKS
category pages have names instead of ids
save reviews (to submit for later)
reviews do not save formatting...



TIME-CONSUMING BUGS
-------------------------------
ON BAD REVIEW VALIDATION, FEATURES ARE STILL ADDED AND FORM IS NOT PREFILLED...

MAYBE WAIT FOR JS...
------------------------------
Navigate photos
list all photos on photo show
drag drop photos in


RECOMMENDED FEATURES TO ADD
-------------------------------







----------------------------------------------

display thumbnail photos on user-sidebar
if user has no pictures...
display compliments...
can edit coompliment
make compliment
show compliments
do categories better (better way than the three columns)
show counters on review votes
show categories in various review partials and business page
show search terms on top of search page
fix columns partial
Search page reviews are not with correct business
go from category page to search with correct search parameters
are categories correct?


Category page
change BusinessFeatures to have review_id instead of user_id
Faker Data
2 columns working
delete reviews
DOES NOT CONSIDER IF USER HAS ALREADY ADDED FEATURES BEFORE....
edit own reviews

Reviews can have pictures
reviews display reverse order
Business Photos Page
submit initial review with new business
clicking photos not going to right page
Rename Category and SubCategory
how does user storefront selection relate to actual storefront
   maybe it should choose the top three storefront images
